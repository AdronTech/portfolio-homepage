For the final project in high school we had to conceptualize and build an embedded system.
The heart of project should be a micro-controller and all the printed circuit boards (PCBs) should be custom made.
All the libraries for the build in peripherals of the embedded micro-controller should also been written from scratch.

### Goal
Each student had the task to find a project in the scope of one school year. In my case I decided to make a hexacopter running on a STM32 micro-controller. The drone should have active stabilization in all three rotary axis and additionally it should feature RGB lighting to indicate different states of the drone.

### Learnings
From the project I learned first how to program a C++ project in an embedded environment, how a PID control loop works and how a drone realizes motor mixing.
